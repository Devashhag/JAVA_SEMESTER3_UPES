//5.Design a class employee of an organization. An employee has a name, empid, and salary.
// Write the default constructor, a constructor with parameters (name, empid, and salary)
// and methods to return name and salary. Also write a method increaseSalary that raises
// the employeeâ€™s salary by a certain user specified percentage. Derive a subclass Manager from
// employee. Add an instance variable named department to the manager class. Supply a test
// program that uses these classes and methods.
